- Change version to 1.0
- Rewrite README into proper README.md
- Rename this effort as a game library of some kind. Not rpg-specific.
- Redesign the Dice and Fudge types to use newtypes instead of type aliases
- Start using unit testing with HUnit and also Tasty
- Move docs like ../../fudge-mythic.gnumeric into the project somewhere
- Bring that Fudge levels chart from the wiki into docs here
- Use `cabal init` to create a new, modern cabal file
- Commit existing work and tag (suggesting `marker03` to go after the last tag)
- Update copyright and similar things everywhere
- Clean up the dice utility

-----
- Take a look at the organization of modules and apps. Ideally looking for separation of generic Rpg, Fudge-specific Rpg and this-game-specific. As well as a clear separation of presentation from all this.

-----
Can I model the cat stalking process?

-----
- Start adding unit testing. Things that need it so far:
   - Rpg.Fudge.Trait.showShort
   - Rpg.Fudge.Skill.skillAdvDiff
   - Rpg.Fudge.Skill.skillAdvDiff'
