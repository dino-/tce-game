Traits in Fudge

Trait
+-Attribute
+-Skill
+-Gift
+-Fault

(all of these things are traits)

-----
other systems:
- Osprey (sucky?)
- WikiRPS
- Yags
- Alternate Realities

-----
Two categories:
- chracter description
- action resolution

-----
computer RPG games I admire
- TES (Daggerfall, Morrowind)
- Fallout (SPECIAL RPG system)
- Jagged Alliance (pre-2 system in particular)

-----
- Fading Suns RPG system similar to Fallout (VPS system)
- Savage Worlds
- Mutants and Masterminds
- Alternity
- RuneQuest has skill advancement. Very old system

-----
- Being able to roll action points to subsequent rounds a-la JA and Fallout
- Do want mental attributes (?)
- Differentiate between physical and mental attributes
- PCs, NPCs and monsters should use same creation mechanisms? This is NOT how D&D (d20, 3.xE) works.
- Exponential scales? This is how Fudge works. Hero does it with Strength
- Body used in Hero to 'counter-weight' Strength. What does this mean?
- Movement rate?
- Hexes or quads?
- Need initiative.

-----
Things I need in any game:

- time of day and time passage
- action points
   - Being able to roll action points forward to subsequent rounds
- movement rate
- skill and attribute advancement
   - What will be the mechanism we use to store training?
- must be able to save anywhere for any reason
- initiative

-----
What types of things can I borrow from some of these past games?

- Jagged Alliance
- Fallout
- TES
- Nethack

-----
Actions points from Fallout RPG

They're based on the Agility Statistic like this:

   Fallout Agility   #AP      Fudge Agility  #AP
         1            5       Superb          11
        2-3           6       Great           10
        4-5           7       Good             9
        6-7           8       Fair             8
        8-9           9       Mediocre         7
        10+          10       Poor             6
                              Terrible         5

   Or by formula: AP = Agility + 8
