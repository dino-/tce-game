-----
computer RPG games I admire
- TES (Daggerfall, Morrowind)
- Fallout (SPECIAL RPG system)
- Jagged Alliance (pre-2 system in particular)

-----
- Fading Suns RPG system similar to Fallout (VPS system)
- Savage Worlds
- Mutants and Masterminds
- Alternity
- RuneQuest has skill advancement. Very old system

-----
- Being able to roll action points to subsequent rounds a-la JA and Fallout
- Do want mental attributes (?)
- Differentiate between physical and mental attributes
- PCs, NPCs and monsters should use same creation mechanisms? This is NOT how D&D (d20, 3.xE) works.
- Exponential scales? This is how Fudge works. Hero does it with Strength
- Body used in Hero to 'counter-weight' Strength. What does this mean?
- Movement rate?
- Hexes or quads?
- Need initiative.
